## Summary of PTA
‚ÄèPTA is the application of a physical therapist using artificial intelligence, the function of the application is for the physical therapist to follow the patient and perform the exercises correctly without the need to visit the hospital or the physical therapy center, so I used many libraries such as Mediapipe and numpy and build a model through them so that the model can monitor the patient's performance and send a detailed report on the quality of the exercise to the therapist and can send feedback to the patient and comments so that he improves his exercise performance
